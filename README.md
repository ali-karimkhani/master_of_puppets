This just demonstrate how you can provision and build sample go app in local environment.

## Dependencies

**Software dependencies.**

* VirtualBox
* Vagrant

## Running stack
For run and build web with 2x GO app just need to run:
```
make stack
```
So now you can check the stack from Nginx load-balancer from `http://localhost:8000` (by refreshing the page app message should be changed). Also it possible to connect to nodes app-1: `http://localhost:8001` app-2: `http://localhost:8002`

### Destroy stack
Run this command to destroy stack
```
make destroy_stack
```

## Running single node (web | app-1 | app-2)
If you need to run one of nodes and connect to vagrant machine via ssh you just need to run this command:
```
make machine ROLE=web
make machine ROLE=app-1
make machine ROLE=app-2
```
### Destroy node
```
make destroy_machine ROLE=web
make destroy_machine ROLE=app-1
make destroy_machine ROLE=app-2
```

## Travis-CI
You can see a build status on Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.org/ali-karimkhani/master_of_puppets.
If the build will be success you should see the result of `curl localhost:8080` something like this:
`Hi there, This is served from testing-worker-linux-docker-4f9c9dca-3389-linux-6!`
